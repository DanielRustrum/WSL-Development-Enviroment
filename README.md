# Multiplat
Multiplat is a Feature-Rich program that focuses on creating a workspace that emphasises key-strengths of both Linux and Windows, even integrating Virtual Box, Docker. But what does this mean? This program is meant to help with workflows that may need the use of automation, cross operating system use, or even as a simple manager between applications.

To achieve this the core of the program is strictly 3 components Cross-System Communication, Extensability, and Management. 
- The **Cross-System Component** handles the communication between systems wether it is WSL, another networked computer, or a different drive.
- The **Extensability Component** handles module which are installed on demand, extensions which are installed on update, or commands which are manually installed.
- The **Management Component** handles the maintenence, security, and access that the program has and gives access.

The reason why I set out to create this program is because I use both linux and windows, but there is always a degree of seperation between the two system, whether it was via Dual Boot, Virtual Machines, Remote Access, or Containerization. These are all good and viable workflows, but these system are at some level isolated from eachother. However with the introduction of WSL especially WSL2, it brings the Linux system within the windows operating system. With WSL we are able to access a linux distro through powershell giving the ability for either multiple distros working together or linux and windows working together.

**Goal:** 
- Increase accessibilty, cross-plateform capability, usability, and increase cross capability between Linux and Windows. 
- Emphasis the strengths of both Linux and Windows
